# Interactive Robot Arm

This repository contains code for an interactive, creative robotic arm system for running in a ROS workspace (tested using Robostack bundling with conda).

The system has capabilities for vision using a USB camera, ChatGPT integration, and face-tracking animatronic eyes. The arm can paint on 2D surfaces.

This version of the project is for collaborative painting, where both the human and the robot work together on an abstract piece.
The robot responds to the marks made by the human user.
