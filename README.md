# Interactive Robot Arm

This repository contains code for an interactive, creative robotic arm system for running in a ROS workspace (tested using Robostack bundling with conda).

The system has capabilities for vision using a USB camera, ChatGPT integration, and face-tracking animatronic eyes. The arm can paint on 2D surfaces.
